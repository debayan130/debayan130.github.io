        <h3><em>Game development</em></h3>
    </center>
    <p class="apara">
        I started making games since 2016 after coming across the Unity Game Engine. Since then, I have creating and testing prototypes to check what works and what doeto check what works and what doesn't. My friend Rudra Nil Basu inspired me to expand my interests, by realising the importance of game design, on how a game with great artwork and technical implementations will fall flat if it doesn't have a proper design. As a designer, I come up with game mechanics based on my restrictions while still keeping it enjoyable and as a programmer I quickly prototype and test the mechanics to make it interesting.
